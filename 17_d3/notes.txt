d3 allows for data to be bound to a DOM and then modify the data as necessary
declarative, operates on arbitrary sets of nodes called selections
mutating nodes: setting attributes, styles, registering event listeners, adding/removing/sorting nodes, changing HTML/text content
styles, attributes, and other properties are functions of data, not constants; mutable
enter & exit can create new nodes for incoming data and remove nodes
d3 does not introduce new visual representation
transitions: animations
can import data and place into a visual diagram, and can modify the diagram as desired- height/width changes, dynamic data (sliders)
d3 does not perform type inference (default string)
