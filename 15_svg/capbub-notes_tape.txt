===== 1 =====
Predictions: will display alerts when user clicks on name
Observations: displays an alert box of the name clicked on


===== 2 =====
Predictions: will propagate from the element up the parent node to table
Observations: displays the name clicked on, then the tr collection the name is part of, then the rest of the tbody collection in order.


===== 3 =====
Predictions: propagate in the reverse order of the second, where the event will be run after going down the tree
Observations: First, the overall table collection is shown, then the name clicked on, then the tr collection the name is part of
Q: What will happen when the next line is uncommented? (e.stopPropagation();)
After the first propagation, which is the entire table, the event stops running down the tree and there is only one alert.
Q: When user clicks on a cell, in what order will the pop-ups appear?
overall table -> name(td) -> tr collection

===== 4 =====
Predictions: the event will run before going down the tree
Observations: first the overall table is shown, then the tr collection the name is part of, then the name
Name the collections of TDs, TRs, and overall table:
TD's : [Yoda],[Luke],[Obi-Wan],[Vader],[Maul],[Palpatine]
TR's : [Yoda, Luke, Obi-Wan], [Vader, Maul, Palpatine]
overall table: [Yoda, Luke, Obi-Wan, Vader, Maul, Palpatine]
Q: Does the order in which the event listeners are attached matter? - it does not, since all eventlisteners are true
