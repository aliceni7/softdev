	  <center><h3>Block + Chain = Digital information stored in a public database</h3></center>
	</div>
	<div class="col c4">
	  <center><h4>Block (contains following)</h4></center>
	  <ul>
	    <li>• Data: transaction information, date, dollar amount, etc.</li>
	    <li>• Digital Signature: username</li>
	    <li>• Hashcode: a unique code to distinguish each block</li>
	    <li>• Each can store thousands of transactions</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
	<div class="col c4">
	  <center><h4>Chain</h4></center>
	  <ul>
	    <li>• A chain is blocks strung together</li>
	    <li>• Each block is added linearly and chronologically</li>
	    <li>• Publicly available for EVERYONE</li>
	    <li>• Updates automatically with each new appended block</li>

	  <ul>
	    <li>• Node: computers connected to blockchain network</li>
	    <li>• Nodes all see same blockchain</li>
	    <li>• Decentralized: everyone owns the information; No third party is necessary</li>

		<p>*** Blockchains can only be updated by consensus between participants in the system, and once new data is entered it can never be erased. It is a write-once, append-many technology, making it a verifiable and auditable record of each and every transaction.</p>

	<center><h3>How are blockchains protected?</h3></center>
	<div class="col c4">
	  <center><h4> Decentralized </h4></center>
	  <p style="text-align:justify">By design, the decentralized system of blockchain makes it hard to hack. If someone wanted to manipulate information on the blockchain, they’d have to manually change each and every single copy of the blockchain out there.<p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="col c4">
	  <center><h4> Hash Codes </h4></center>
	  <p style="text-align:justify">Each block contains its own personal hash code and the hash of the previous block. These hashes connect the blocks on the blockchain, so it’s impossible to change one block without changing every other block. That means hacks are very traceable and difficult to carry out.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="col c4">
	  <center><h4> Consensus Models </h4></center>
	  <p style="text-align:justify">To add blocks to a chain, each computer has to pass a test, called consensus models, to verify that the information on the block is trustworthy. One such test is the proof of work system, which is implemented by bitcoin.</p>

	  <div class="col c12">
	    <center><h3>What is bitcoin?</h3></center>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">Bitcoin is an online cryptocurrency that became popular because it operates on a decentralized authority, meaning it’s untraceable and secure. Blockchain was implemented in 2008 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto to serve as a public transaction ledger for bitcoin.</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="col c12">
	    <center><h3>How do you mine a bitcoin?</h3></center>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">Whenever a new block is added to a blockchain, miners check if the transactions within the block are accurate to prevent "double-spending". In exchange for their work on verifying numerous transactions, miners are awarded bitcoin, or “block rewards”.To do so, they solve a block's highly complex computational math problem, the "proof of work." More specifically, they must come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number that is less than or equal to a target hashcode that is changed periodically for security. Trying to get that target hashcode is basically guesswork and reliant on how fast your computer can generate that hash.</p>
